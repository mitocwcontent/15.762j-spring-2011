Prerequisites
-------------

Students should have completed one of the following courses:

[ESD.260J/ 1.260J/15.770J Logistics Systems](/courses/esd-260j-logistics-systems-fall-2006)

[15.760 Introduction to Operations Management](/courses/15-760b-introduction-to-operations-management-spring-2004)

[15.761 Operations Management](/courses/15-761-introduction-to-operations-management-spring-2013)

Course Objective
----------------

To develop modeling skills and to provide new concepts and problem-solving tools applicable to the design and planning of supply chains.

Course Description
------------------

_15.762J Supply Chain_ Planning focuses on effective supply chain strategies for companies that operate globally, with an emphasis on how to plan and integrate supply chain components into a coordinated system. Students are exposed to concepts and models important in supply chain planning with emphasis on key tradeoffs and phenomena. The course introduces and utilizes key tactics such as risk pooling and inventory placement, integrated planning and collaboration, and information sharing. Lectures, computer exercises, and case discussions introduce various models and methods for supply chain analysis and optimization.
